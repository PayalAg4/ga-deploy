In July, hackers were able to access Twitter's internal systems and seize control of accounts, including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and former US President Barack Obama, and solicit digital currency. Twitter has said its employees were duped into sharing account credentials.

Lawmakers have expressed concerns over what would happen if a similar breach occurred a day before the US presidential election on November 3.

After the hack, the White House said it had been in constant contact with Twitter to ensure the security of President Donald Trump's Twitter account, which was not jeopardised in the hack.
